# Osmosis Training Configuration
# Copy and customize this file for your training run.
#
# Usage: osmosis train submit configs/training/<your-config>.toml
# For AI agents or automation, use `osmosis --json ...` or `osmosis --plain ...`.
#
# Supported models:
#   - Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
#   - Qwen/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B

# lr = 1e-6                           # Learning rate

[sampling]
# rollout_temperature = 1.0           # Sampling temperature during rollouts

[checkpoints]
# eval_interval =                     # Evaluate every N rollouts (optional)
# checkpoint_save_freq = 20           # Save checkpoint every N rollouts

# ── Environment variables & secrets ───────────────────────────────────────────
# Both sections are optional. Omit them entirely if your rollout needs no
# additional environment configuration.
#
# [rollout.env]
# Literal key = "value" pairs injected verbatim into the rollout container.
# Values are visible in this file and in CLI output — do NOT put secrets here.
# Keys must match ^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$ and must not be reserved names (see below).
#
# Example:
#   LOG_LEVEL = "INFO"
#   DEFAULT_REGION = "us-west-2"
#
# [rollout.secrets]
# Maps env-var names to workspace environment_secret record *names*.
# Values are resolved server-side from the workspace's encrypted secret store
# and injected into the container — they never appear in this file or in transit.
# Pre-register secrets at /:orgName/secrets in the platform UI before submitting.
#
# Example:
#   OPENAI_API_KEY = "openai-api-key"   # value is the *name* of the secret record
#
# Reserved names (cannot appear in either section — managed by the platform):
#   GITHUB_CLONE_URL  GITHUB_TOKEN  ENTRYPOINT_SCRIPT  REPOSITORY_PATH
#   TRAINING_RUN_ID   ROLLOUT_NAME  ROLLOUT_PORT
